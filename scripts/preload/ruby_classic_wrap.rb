# iOS ships Ruby 1.8 (see ios/Empo/project.yml -lruby18-static).

# raise NoMethodError. Stub them as no-ops so scripts that sprinkle
# `.force_encoding("UTF-8")` on strings don't crash.

# The Encoding class doesn't exist in Ruby 1.8 either. Games that
# reference Encoding::UTF_8 or similar still error out with NameError.
# The String#force_encoding stub above tolerates any argument type, so
# a dedicated Encoding stub is not required in the common case.
