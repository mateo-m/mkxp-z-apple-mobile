# per-thread locks replaced the GIL. Vintage RGSS and Essentials code

#
# On Ruby 1.9+ those calls raise `NoMethodError`, usually during quit
# or save, where `pbExit` calls `pbSave` which sets
# `Thread.critical = true`. That has crashed the engine outright: the
# error escapes the script-eval loop, and the iOS shutdown path then
# segfaults because the Ruby VM still has an exception pending when
# SharedState::finiInstance() runs.
#
# Restore both as no-ops wherever they are missing. The 1.8
# cooperative-scheduling semantics mean nothing under modern Ruby,
# and calling code only ever cared that the methods existed.

#
# Essentials' `pbExit`, and its forks such as Vanguard and Reborn,
# use `exit!` so a quit click skips the "press any key" splash that
# `at_exit` would trigger. That is a fine choice on desktop. On iOS
# the app just vanishes, and the engine never learns the user quit.
#

# --- Win32 library null-stub via const_missing ---
# Win32-only library scripts (RGSS Linker, FMODEX, network loaders, etc.)
# reference constants that never get defined on iOS because DLL loading is a
# no-op (see win32_wrap.rb). Instead of adding per-library stubs, hook
# Module#const_missing so any undefined constant - top-level OR nested
# inside a partially-defined module like Berka::NetErrorErr - resolves to
# a safe stub rather than raising NameError.
#
# Two kinds of stubs are returned:
#
# 1. Constants whose name ends in Error, Err, Exception, or Failure become
#    real StandardError subclasses. This matters because games commonly
#    write `raise Berka::NetErrorErr, "msg"`. The raised exception must
#    inherit from Exception or Ruby rejects it, and if it is NullStub the
#    alert ends up showing "IOS::NullStub" as the error message.
#
# 2. Everything else becomes IOS::NullStub, which silently absorbs any
#    method call and any nested constant lookup. This covers library
#    namespaces like FmodEx, FmodEx::System, etc.
#
# NullStub is also raisable. Games sometimes raise a typo'd nested
# constant that only resolves on iOS (Daybreak's downloader does
# `raise Berka::NetErrorErr::ConIn`. `ConIn` has no error suffix, so
# it resolves to NullStub). What `raise <stub>` does depends on the
# VM:
#
# - Ruby 1.9+ coerces the argument through `to_str` first, so the
#   stub raises as a RuntimeError with an empty message. Ugly, but
#   not fatal.
# - Ruby 1.8 accepts only real Strings, then requires the argument
#   to respond to `exception`. method_missing does not satisfy that
#   check, so the script's own raise dies with a fatal
#   "exception class/object expected" TypeError.
# - The two-argument form `raise <stub>, msg` requires `exception`
#   on every VM.
#
# The explicit `exception` hook below makes the 1.8 and two-argument
# paths produce a plain StandardError with a readable message.

# fail on `Hash#[]` even though the constant itself resolves.
#
# Ported from JoiPlay's preload.rb. `dlopen` returns a populated

# --- Socket / network stubs ---
# Our embedded Ruby doesn't compile the network stdlib (socket,
# net/http, net/https, openssl, uri) and games can't install user
# gems (discord-rpc, poke-api-v2, rest-client). Without help a
# single `require 'socket'` at the top of a bootstrap script
# raises LoadError and terminates the whole eval, so Reborn and
# similar games don't even reach the title screen. We solve this
# in two layers:
#
# 1. Provide minimal no-op classes for socket primitives (below)
#    so scripts that do `TCPSocket.open(...)` don't NameError
#    later on.
# 2. Intercept Kernel#require with an allowlist of known-missing
#    network stdlib + gems. If the require matches the allowlist
#    and the original require raises LoadError, we swallow it and
#    return false (mimicking "already loaded") so the calling
#    script continues. Non-network requires still propagate.
#
# TODO: compile Ruby with network stdlib so online features
# work. See TODO.md "Engine / compatibility".

# --- rbconfig fallback ---
# Our embedded Ruby doesn't ship `rbconfig` (it's generated per-arch
# at Ruby build time, so it never lands in the static ext set).
# Desktop-targeting games hit it indirectly - e.g. Pokemon Reborn's
# bundled rubyzip does `require 'rbconfig'` on the non-JoiPlay path
# and reads CONFIG['host_os'] to pick Windows vs POSIX path
# handling. Reborn ships its own stdlib copies of rbconfig.rb but
# only pushes the arch subdir (stdlib/x64-mingw32 etc.) onto the
# load path for platforms it knows about, so on iOS the require
# fails and the whole script eval aborts.
#
# When `require 'rbconfig'` raises LoadError, install a minimal
# darwin-flavored RbConfig instead - iOS is closest to macOS (POSIX
# paths, case-insensitive FS), so callers branch away from the
# Windows-specific path handling that would corrupt our paths.
# Installing a real module matters: merely swallowing the require
# would leave `RbConfig::CONFIG['host_os']` to the const_missing
# NullStub, whose method_missing chain is always-truthy and would
# match ANY `=~ /mswin|mingw/` probe as Windows.
#
# Lazy (hooked into the require rescue below, not pre-defined) so a
# game that gets a real rbconfig.rb onto the load path still loads
# the genuine article without constant-redefinition noise.

# --- Socket class stubs ---
# Removed. Pokemon Essentials forks (Insurgence, Reborn) ship
# their own Sockets script that defines TCPSocket / UDPSocket /
# BasicSocket with their own class hierarchy.
#
# A stub here never survives those scripts, and the way it fails
# depends on the Ruby version. On 1.9 and 3.1 the game's definition
# raises "superclass mismatch", and the script loop skips the rest
# of that section. On 1.8 nothing raises at all, because
# ruby18/rgss-superclass-override.patch restores the RGSS1 rule
# that the last definition wins. The stub is then replaced in
# silence. A stub helps in neither case.
#
# Games that need network stubs must ship their own. With
# networking enabled the real socket classes come from the
# statically-linked ext instead (gated in extinit so offline mode
# still matches this old behavior). Games that call Winsock
# through Win32API reach the network through Win32API_Impl::Ws2_32
# in win32_wrap.rb.

# --- Eager static extension load ---
# The socket and openssl extensions are statically linked into the
# Ruby 3.1 VM. They initialize lazily, on the first `require`. Some
# games replace `Kernel#require` with a loader that searches the load
# path for plain .rb files and evals them (Rejuvenation's
# ScriptLoader does this). Such a loader cannot start a static
# extension: `require 'socket.so'` finds no file and returns false.
# The stdlib wrapper then evals into hollow classes, and the C-only
# constants (IPSocket, the OpenSSL internals) never exist. The first
# stdlib file that touches one crashes. Example: ipaddr.rb sees no
# Socket::AF_INET6, takes its no-IPv6 branch, and its
# `class << IPSocket` block raises a NameError inside the game's
# update flow.
#
# Load both extensions here, through the real `require`, before any
# game code runs. The real `require` records the absolute stdlib
# paths in $LOADED_FEATURES. Replacement loaders honor that list, so
# they skip these files and the real classes stay in place. The
# eager load does not conflict with the stub-removal note above: the
# 1.8/1.9 VMs do not link the extensions, and the version gate skips
# them, so no class appears there. The gate reads System.ruby_version
# (the C API version), not RUBY_VERSION, because the syntax-transform
# layer can mimic an old RUBY_VERSION on the 3.1 VM. When networking
# is off, the airplane-mode section below still patches the connect
# surface.

# ScriptLoader does exactly this). The host already exports a
# working SSL_CERT_FILE for Ruby's openssl. Letting a game point it
# at a file that doesn't exist in the iOS import silently breaks
# every TLS handshake with "unable to get local issuer
# certificate". Honor the game's assignment when the file is really
# there (game-relative paths resolve against the game dir, our
# cwd), otherwise keep the host trust store.

# code takes the same rescue paths it takes on a device with no
# connectivity. Local binds/listens are left alone (they work in
# airplane mode too). On the 1.8/1.9 VMs the socket classes aren't
# registered while offline, so these guards simply never match.
