# windows_fs.rb
# Windows filesystem-semantics emulation layer.
# Auto-loaded before platform_compat.rb and game scripts. Games
# authored on Windows lean on OS behavior the device filesystem does
# not give them: case-insensitive paths, text-mode reads, a system
# font directory, and save files next to the executable. The modules
# and File / FileTest / Dir wrappers here rebuild those semantics.
# Engine-generic runtime shims live in platform_compat.rb, and
# Essentials-specific patches live in pokemon_compat.rb.

# Windows guarantees a system font directory, and games write into
# it without a mkdir: the stock Essentials FontInstaller copies its
# font files to "<SystemRoot>\Fonts\" and reads them back on the
# next launch as its "already installed" check. The faked
# SystemRoot points at the per-game data root, so map that one
# Windows-only shape onto a real "Fonts" folder there - for reads
# and writes alike, or the installed-check never passes. Every
# other path keeps MKXPSaveFS's literal resolution.

    # The sweep below moves it back into the folder the game reads.
    #
    # The sweep is access-driven. No boot-time gate can know whether
    # a game resolves saves through the portable dir. Rejuvenation-
    # lineage builds go portable on the launcher identity alone
    # (RTP.isPortable -> mobile? -> $empo/$kirin), with no marker
    # file and no JoiPlay toggle. And a $joiplay-keyed boot sweep
    # would move root saves for games that never read the portable
    # dir. So the wrappers watch for the game itself to touch
    # portable save content. The first qualifying access runs one
    # sweep per boot:
    #  - an enumeration of the portable dir (the Reborn-lineage
    #    load screens list it), or
    #  - a file access under "Save Data/" that misses literally
    #    while the flattened counterpart exists at the root.
    # A bare probe of a missing marker never qualifies. A
    # non-portable game that only checks "Save Data/.portable"
    # keeps its root saves untouched.
    #
    # The sweep moves every stranded entry, subdirectories included
    # (the alias flattened "Save Data/Battle Logs/..." the same
    # way). Engine bookkeeping entries and host ".empo-" artifacts
    # stay at the root. On a name collision the newer mtime wins
    # the canonical name (ties go to the root copy, which the alias
    # preferred for both reads and writes). The loser is kept
    # beside it as *.pre-literal.bak.
    # Paths resolve against the engine cwd (the game folder, set by
    # main.cpp/config.cpp before the binding boots), the same base
    # the game's own "Save Data/" strings resolve against. The cwd
    # guard skips the sweep while a game has chdir'd elsewhere.

# Errno::ENOENT on every Ruby version. Both are no-ops in spirit
# (the script wants "stay where you are") so we route them through
# the no-arg form, which is safe and well-defined (returns to home
# dir or no-op when called with a block on no-arg).

# --- Portable-save migration arming ---
# The sweep is access-driven (see the portable-save migration
# section in MKXPSaveFS): the wrappers above watch for the game to
# touch portable "Save Data" content, and the first qualifying
# access runs one sweep per boot through the _mkxp_orig_* aliases.
# No boot-time gate: launcher-identity portable modes
# (Rejuvenation's RTP.isPortable -> mobile? -> $empo) are invisible
# before game scripts run, and a $joiplay-keyed boot sweep would
# move root saves for games that never read the portable dir.
