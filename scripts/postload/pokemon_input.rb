# Pokemon Essentials compatibility fixes.
# Adapted from JoiPlay's pokefix.rb / pokeinput.rb
# (https://github.com/joiplay/android-mkxp/blob/master/app/src/main/assets/).
#
# Pokemon Essentials games ship with a desktop-keyboard name-entry
# scene and an Input module override that polls Win32API. Both
# break on iOS. This postload runs after the game's scripts have
# loaded (so `$PokemonSystem` exists) and before Main starts, and
# applies:
#
#   1. Top-level `USEKEYBOARDTEXTENTRY` forced to false. Stock
#      Essentials `pbEnterText` branches on this constant to pick
#      between `PokemonEntryScene` (desktop keyboard) and
#      `PokemonEntryScene2` (the game's in-game keyboard scene).
#      Uranium and other fan games re-assign it from their
#      Settings script after our preload runs, so the override has
#      to land in postload to win.
#   2. `PokemonEntryScene::USEKEYBOARD` forced off as a belt-and-braces
#      safety net for fan games that dispatch on the class-scoped
#      constant instead of the top-level one.
#   3. Input methods redirected to j-prefixed native implementations
#      so games overriding `Input` with Win32API polling still see
#      touch / gamepad events.

  # Persist a "this is PE" marker in the host-managed state dir.
  # The host-side static detector (GameSettings.detectPokemonEssentials)
  # can't see PE signatures inside rgssad-protected archives, so
  # without this, GameSettings UI would default the In-game keyboard
  # toggle OFF on every launch even though the game IS PE. The
  # marker tips off the next launch's UI so the toggle defaults ON.

  # bridge each backspace is a single 50ms scancode injection -
  # `Input.triggerex?(:BACKSPACE)` correctly reports true on the
  # right frame but PE's update flow doesn't act on it, so the
  # name field never shrinks. PE 21 wired the trigger path
  # directly. This preempt covers the older versions and is
  # redundant-but-safe on PE 21.

  # scene needs custom keys / layout - only those games get the
  # historical force-disable, leaving the majority on the polished
  # soft-keyboard path.
  #
  # NOTE: this check happens once at postload time, so flipping
  # the GameSettings toggle requires a game relaunch to take

  # the engine starts running scripts, so once postload finishes
  # `USEKEYBOARDTEXTENTRY` is locked for the session.

    # ninety lines further down the same method.

    # The engine advances the trigger edge on every `Input.update`, so
    # that second call throws the press away before anything reads it.
    # On Windows the games get away with this: their Input module polls
    # GetAsyncKeyState and advances a key only when that key is READ,
    # so extra updates cost nothing.
    #

    # opened, and talking to an NPC or reading a sign worked only when
    # a keypress happened to land between the mid-frame update and the
    # read.
    #
    # So track the trigger edge here under the same read-driven rule:
    # a button advances on its first read after each `Input.update`,
