# Ruby 1.9: patches and build notes

## Source

- **Upstream**: Ruby 1.9.3 (`v1_9_3_551` tag, last 1.9 release, 2014)
- **Branch**: `ruby_1_9_3` (submodule at `sources/ruby19`)
- **Commit**: `a32f378`

## Why Ruby 1.9?

Most RPG Maker VX (RGSS2) and VX Ace (RGSS3) games target Ruby 1.9.2.
A host picks the Ruby for each game (`mkxp_setActiveRubyVersion`) and
sends RGSS2 and RGSS3 games to this build. Developers also
tested most VX Ace games against the 1.9 series. Syntax that is valid
only in 1.9 (block-local variables, `__method__`) then parses correctly,
with no fallback to Ruby 3.1's syntax-transform patches.

## Patches

All iOS patches are in `ios.patch`. The makefile applies it
automatically via `git apply` before `autoconf`:

### `config.guess` and `config.sub`: updated for aarch64

The 2014-era autoconf helper scripts do not recognize modern platform
triplets like `aarch64-apple-darwin`. We replaced both files with
current GNU config versions so cross-compilation to iOS works.

### `cont-aligned-stacksize.patch`: byte arithmetic for fiber stacks

The makefile applies this patch separately, after `ios.patch`. It
forces `cont.c`'s fiber machine-stack size computation through
`char *` casts. ALLOC_N and MEMCPY then agree on a byte count, even
when the two `VALUE *` operands are not `sizeof(VALUE)`-aligned
relative to each other. Without this patch, clang's
pointer-subtraction-implies-aligned optimization produces a 0-7 byte
heap overflow on every fiber switch on iOS arm64. The overflow shows
up as freelist corruption traps in xzone malloc deeper into game
execution. See the patch header for the full reasoning.

### Engine-side accommodations (in mkxp-z, not in Ruby source)

These are not patches to Ruby itself. They are engine-side adaptations
that Ruby 1.9 needs on iOS:

1. **16MB RGSS thread stack**: Ruby 1.9's GC scans the entire thread
   stack for object references. The default 512KB iOS pthread stack
   triggers SIGBUS when GC hits the guard page, and even 1MB is too
   small for deep RGSS3 script call chains plus fiber stack-copy.
   The workaround calls `SDL_CreateThreadWithStackSize` with 16MB.
   iOS commits stack pages lazily, so this costs only virtual address
   space, not physical RAM.

2. **VM persistence**: `ruby_init()` is one-shot per process. The
   engine calls it once and reuses the VM across game sessions for
   the lifetime of the app.

## iOS build instructions

```bash
cd deps
make -f iphoneos.make ruby19          # device build
make -f iphonesimulator.make ruby19   # simulator build
```

The makefile:

1. Applies `ios.patch` (config.guess/config.sub bumps)
2. Runs `autoconf` to generate `configure`
3. Cross-compiles with the iOS toolchain
4. Builds the core library (`libruby19-static.a`)
5. Builds bundled extensions (zlib, stringio, strscan, thread, digest,
   fcntl) into `libruby19-ext.a`
6. Installs libs to `$(LIBDIR)` and headers to `$(INCLUDEDIR)/ruby19/`
