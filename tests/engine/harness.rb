# Assertion and reporting harness for the engine test suites in this
# directory. Each suite loads it on its first lines, because the
# engine skips "preloadScript" for games that boot from a
# "customScript".
#
# Every line starts with "[TEST] ", which is how a runner tells suite
# output apart from the rest of the engine log:
#
#   [TEST] SUITE <name>
#   [TEST] PLAN <n>
#   [TEST] INFO <key>=<value>
#   [TEST] ok <name>
#   [TEST] FAIL <name> -- <reason>
#   [TEST] PEND <name> -- <reason>
#   [TEST] DONE passed=<n> failed=<n> pending=<n>
#
# PLAN states how many checks the suite is about to run. A runner
# compares it against the DONE totals, so a suite that dies halfway
# through cannot report a clean run.
#
# PEND means the engine refused the operation with a known "not
# supported" error. A check that the engine cannot do yet reports
# PEND, not FAIL, so the same suite runs before and after a port.
# When the engine gains the operation, the line turns into ok with
# no edit to the suite.
#
# PEND is off by default. A suite turns it on only where the gap is
# expected, with EngineTest.pending_allowed = true. Everywhere else
# an unimplemented operation is a defect, so it reports FAIL.
#
# This file must parse on Ruby 1.8, 1.9, and 3.x. The engine picks
# the interpreter per game.
