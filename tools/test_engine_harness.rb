# Tests for tests/engine/harness.rb, the reporting layer the
# in-engine suites use.
#
# A harness that reports the wrong outcome turns a broken engine into
# a green run. Two cases matter most. The engine's error classes
# (MKXPError and friends) descend from Exception, not from
# StandardError, so a rescue that names StandardError lets them past
# and kills the suite mid-run. And an operation the engine has not
# implemented must report PEND, not FAIL, or a port cannot tell a
# missing feature from a defect.
#
# The third case: a check that asserts nothing must not report ok,
# and PEND must stay behind a switch the suite turns on. Both keep a
# green run from meaning less than it reads.
#
# Run: ruby mkxp-z-apple-mobile/tools/test_engine_harness.rb
